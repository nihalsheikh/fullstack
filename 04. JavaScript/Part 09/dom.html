    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="description">
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer
        Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from
        a surge in teenage demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom
        teens could identify. As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to
        "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in comic books. In his autobiography,
        Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence,
        and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was inspired by seeing a
        spider climb up a wallâ€”adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often
        he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.
